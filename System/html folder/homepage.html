                    <h3>Historical Background of Sta. Cruz Learning Center</h3>
                    <p>The school started its operation in June 2001, for school year 2001-2002, bearing the name STA. CRUZ LEARNING CENTER, named after the Patron Saint of the barangay where this school is located. 
                        <br><br>On this school’s first year of operations, a two-room makeshift structure was utilized for the kindergarten classes composed of 45 kids each. The administration was run by a mother-daughter tandem, later becoming the School Director and the Student Activity Coordinator, respectively.
                        <br><br>The following year opened doors for primary grade schoolers. In 2004, a 2-storey-6-room concrete building was constructed and in the opening of the next school year of 2004, it accommodated the complete elementary grades classes. This was the first phase of the now TERESITA BUILDING. Simultaneous with the opening for intermediate classes, the Secondary level also opened enrolment.
                        <br><br>In the following year, (2005) another building rose. It was a 2-storey-10- room concrete building, now the ZACARIAS BUILDING; the ground floor classrooms are now utilized for the Junior High School Class, the second-floor rooms house the computer lab, the library, and the Audio-Visual room.  
                        <br><br>The first batch of First year High School class of this school was composed of 7 students – 4 boys and 3 girls – handled by a licensed BSEd graduate. The 5 of them – 4 boys and 1 girl, were confirmed graduation on March 31,2008. 
                        <br><br>The Government Recognition for the Pre-school and Elementary Grades Programs were granted on the 5th of August, 2008. The Secondary Level was granted Government Recognition No. 24 s. 2008 on August 8,2008.
                        <br><br>After having proved capability for accommodating and training young adolescents, SCLC thought of seeking certification from the PEAC – Private Education Assistance Committee, through the FAPE- Fund for Assistance to Private Education. After 2 unsuccessful attempts in 2011-2012, this school now waves a proud FAPE Certification, having passed evaluation in November 23,2016. 
                        <br><br>Year 2017 is SCLC’s 16th year of being an educational institution. Its facilities are; a library, a Computer Lab, an Audio-Visual Room, a Cultural Activity Center, a TLE Lab, and a newly-constructed Administration Building. The faculty includes: 2 Pre-school teachers, 10 Elementary grades teachers, 8 Junior High School teachers and one Computer teacher, supported by a Guidance Coordinator, a Student Activity Coordinator, a School Nurse, a Registrar and a Library Custodian, headed by a School Principal, under a School Director.
                        <br><br>In 2004, a 2-storey-6-room concrete building (TERESITA BUILDING) was constructed, followed by ZACARIAS BUILDING in 2005. Over the years, SCLC expanded, adding more facilities and achieving various recognitions, including PEAC certification in 2016. Today, SCLC boasts a well-equipped campus with dedicated faculty and staff.
